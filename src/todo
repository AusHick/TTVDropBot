Todo:

Priority:
- Get All Already gotten Drops from Twitch, to prevent loop and filter all Channels out witch are already claimed.
    -> Would Fix this:
        At the moment there is no difference in Drop is already claimed or Drop Progress was not started yet. Could Result in Endless Retry loop.

- Check if the all Live Channels on 100% Drop Event works.
- Remove Xpaths and use loops to loop throw all drops and get their status.
- Event for All Channels Offline

For Later:
- Give the User the ability to add Custom Urls
- Ability to go back to the selecting Twitch Channel by pressing a Key to switch channels while the Programm is running.
- The Bot should automaticlly stop if the user has all Drops.




Already Done:
- Improve the 100% Event. Change it from Randomly selecting a channel to Randomly select a channel and exclude the current one. [Done]
- No Event at the moment to handel the Situation of all avaiable Streams Have 100% on the Drop. Bot would Look for new channel every 2 Minutes -> Bad Performance. [Done]
- Stop the Bot by Pressing a key and not by terminating the window. [Done]
